If you want to add new language. Please request new language via Transifex system.

## For developers

If you have something new texts which needs translation, please add the strings to `../assets/locales/ja.json` and make a pull request to `development`branch. You can use same string for key and value.

We are using [nuxt-i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n) as a translation system. Please refer [their document](https://nuxtjs.org/examples/i18n/) to know how to use the library.

After the text was translated, an organizer will apply new resources on the `development` branch.
